Project 2 Milestone 1

The animation is showing user's locations in random locations around the canvus. Holding down the mouse button will stop the animation.
The interactive data represents a graph of dots that are plotted in a xy system where x is the user's reputation and y(positive going in the downward direction) is the number of views. 
You also have the ability to interact with the graph by click and dragging as well as zooming in and out by the scroll button.
